# Feather "Client" Alternatives

Feather "Client" is a Forge/Fabric mod marketing itself as a client, claiming immense FPS boosts and wide mod support.
However, Feather, on numerous occasions, has been caught illegally stealing code and breaking other mod's licenses.
Despite the overwhelming amount of evidence, their admins and moderators refuse to acknowledge it and avoid it.
Feather is also unsupported by many mod authors, as Feather is closed source and obfuscated, and so incompatibilies cannot
be fixed by mod authors. It is not recommended to use Feather or support the developers behind the "client". All major
performance improvements can be gotten from using the original mods that Feather leeches off.

Additionally, I do not personally trust them. If they are unable to write their own code for their features, I do not trust
them to write proper security measures as by using Feather you are essentially giving them access to your Microsoft/Minecraft
account. Their Discord server also refuses to ban scammers, as on several occasions myself and others have been told that it
is not their problem.
