# Essential Alternatives

??? note "Essential sucks"

    Its new microtransaction system is predatory, purposefully designed to charge you more than what it would cost you prior to the new currency update.
    Essential now uses a new in game currency in order to buy cosmetics, similar to Fortnite V-Bucks. The amount of currency you can buy and the price
    of cosmetics is purposefully placed so that you always have to buy extra coins than you need to buy an item, forcing you to spend extra. This
    business practice is incredibly anticonsumer and profit driven.
    
    Essential also tries to market itself as a mod library. Because of this, if another mod wants to use something Essential offers, all users of the
    mod are forced to install Essential alongside the original mod. There is no way around this. If you are a mod developer, please look elsewhere for
    the features Essential offers. I especially recommend avoiding vigialnce, due to its myriad of issues that have been known but not fixed for years.
    
    Essential has tracking and data collection. This information may be shared to third parties as can be read in their [privacy policy](https://essential.gg/privacy-policy),
    as well as what data they collect.
    
    Lastly, Essential is a half-baked mod. Almost every promise for new features has yet to be delivered since and before its release. Additionally,
    the features Essential currently has are purposefully made to be worse than other mods. Most obvious of this is their built in zoom, which despite
    some of its features being copied from Patcher, most of its functionality and customization was not adeded to make it "easier for new players".

Don't feel forced to use Essential!
