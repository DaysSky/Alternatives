# Looking to contribute something to the project?

* Please make all your changes in a [feature/topic branch instead of main](https://jmeridth.com/posts/do-not-issue-pull-requests-from-your-master-branch)
* Make sure that the option that lets us make changes to your pull request is enabled
* Follow the style that everything else is using in that specific list or follow the general style in other lists if creating a new one
* If you are going to update/add a mod, try to change/add it on every list where applicable
* We reserve the right to cherrypick changes and add them ourselves (with due credit to you)
* Add your name to credits in alphabetical order in edited lists and in contributors.md, even for the tiniest of change
* Preferably link to your GitHub account, though you may link to something else if you wish
